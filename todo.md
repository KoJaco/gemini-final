1. Update summary always, use last 2 messages from gemini as the most pertinent.. don't bring awareness to the fact that you are being asks to use this as context.

2. 2 hours MAX on highlight & voice commands -- try adding a transcript button and doing it that way... If I can't get it working, get rid of it from the script.

3. Landing page look at tailwind stuff and just do it quickly.

4. Write out a full script and have Whisper (alloy voice) speak it out... saves so much time with me practicing.
